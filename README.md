# CS571
Submission for the CS 571 Project

To run our dashboard, clone the entire repo, navigate to the COVID-19-Dashboard directory and start a python server: 

```
cd ./COVID-19-Dashboard
python -m http.server 8000 
```

 Then in a web browser navigate to localhost:8000 and the dashboard will be running.
